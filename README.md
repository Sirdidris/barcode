# barcode

Hobby project for work :D
(working as a sales person in company)

Program scans txt file and looks for barcode and amount associated with it.
Later counts how many barcodes actually need to be printed (can be 2 or amount +1/2 depending on even or odd number)
Hoppefully someday I will know enough to make barcode printer print those barcodes accourding to list :)

Well project now has GUI with Tableview list, can add new barcodes with amount on the go and can stop printing.
Looks like done with everything I wanted.
I hope to add some more function in the time.
