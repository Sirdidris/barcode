# barcode

Hobby project for work :D
(working as a sales person in company)

Program scans txt file and looks for barcode and amount associated with it.
Later counts how many barcodes actually need to be printed (can be 2 or amount +1/2 depending on even or odd number)
Hoppefully someday I will know enough to make barcode printer print those barcodes accourding to list :)

Created GUI with variants to print barcodes for 3 different type of companies. Choosing file and choosingtype is from GUI.
Printing button is in GUI too.
